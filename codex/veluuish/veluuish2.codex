    "The Vat'iish are a prideful faction and, while they are intelligent, they scorn the Kir'vat and their 'cowardly' ways, choosing instead to forge thepath of the warrior. They use the galaxy as their own personal trophy cabinet, seiging inhabited worlds and taking over the settlements that may bestationed there just to show that they can. They are cunning, deceitful, and will never do anything for anyone without a good incentive to do so."
