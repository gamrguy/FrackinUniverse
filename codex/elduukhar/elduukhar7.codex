"The Eld'uukhar have two governing bodies, the temple council, and the people's council. The people's council answers to the temple council. The people's council is elected, whereas the temple council is decided based on the will of four priests, two male, two female, who consume Exonite crystals to elicit communication between the deities and themselves, and through this decide who will be appointed (As an aside, the consumption of Exonite is forbidden to all but these four, who are replaced by their children when they eventually die)."
