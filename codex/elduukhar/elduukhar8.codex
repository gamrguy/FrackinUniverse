"The head of the council is chosen once every ten years through this method, a male one decade, and a female the next. It is considered their divine right to rule, and their word sways the entire races' social/economic development for the next ten years. In more recent times, this has been abused, and the current head of the temple council - Ka'tir Upitah - intends to keep her rule until she eventually dies, claiming to be a direct messenger from the deity Ahvis.
