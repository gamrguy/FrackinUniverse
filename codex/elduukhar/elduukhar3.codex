    "Apparently a holy text, this codex details a creature referred to as Ahvis and her divine guidance over the Eld'uukhar people. Most specifically, it details her literal link to all crystalline formations in the universe. The importance of the Male and Female Purpose are spoken of in great detail, likely pointing to a gender-based role-heavy society in the historical context. The effects of various crystals on the genders is explored in excruciatingly boring detail.",
    "Allegedly, red crystals when imbibed by a male Eld'uukhar, result in a `sexual deviant that will mate with more than one dragon`, while a green crystal ingested by a female will cause the same effect. A blue crystal by either is said to bring euphoria, but only if it is sky blue. Cyan will lead to psychosis...apparently. This is likely not fact, and more than likely heavily influenced by dogmatic principles."
