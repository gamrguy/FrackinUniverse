"Eld'uukhar choose a mate for life, and when a life mate is chosen, the couple must ask to be blessed in a temple by a priest representing Sahkris, and a priestess representing Ahvis. In order to gain this blessing, each consume one half of a Rasiline crystal - which has similar chemical properties to Exonite - and if they can endure the hallucinations that follow, they can continue with the ceremony."
