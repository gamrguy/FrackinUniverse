    "As the prophet of Ahvis, I can attest to the vile nature of her supposed husband, Sahkris. She has spoken to me through my dreams. He and his children alike are betrayers, and care for none but themselves. The spirit of Sahkris lies dormant in his children, your husbands, your brothers, and your sons.",
    "We as children of Ahvis must take revenge. Abandon those whom you hold most dear, for they will always have a knife ready at your back. Trust only in Ahvis, and trust only in me, her prophet, for I will protect you, I will guide you, and I will always be with you."
